00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:10.585
Aaaah

00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:12.231
It's Rewind time.

00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:16.062
If I controlled Rewind I would want

00:00:16.062 --> 00:00:19.223
Fortnite and Marques Brownlee.

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:25.848
Is this what you wanted?

00:00:25.848 --> 00:00:27.735
You know who I would have asked for?

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.501
Quit horsing around.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.456
Play me some of that jumping music.

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:34.012
Did you say jumping music?

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:35.338
Jumping music?

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:40.902
Everybody! Off!

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:50.039
Not even a thank you?!

00:00:57.676 --> 00:00:59.438
Is that Marques?

00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:01.035
I want Liza!

00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:08.049
Yeaaaaaahhhh!!!!

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:16.017
So guys, apparently
we control Rewind this year.

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:20.859
Y'all we can do whatever we want.
What do we do?

00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:28.310
There's one thing this video needs.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.299
K-pop!

00:01:48.973 --> 00:01:51.132
Can I have a Royal Wedding?

00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:52.862
Yeah, but you're marrying Bongo Cat.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:53.863
Wait, what?

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:03.921
Rewind needs more science.

00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:05.394
Can we do an experiment?

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.117
I love that. Melting lipstick.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.562
I want to eat something.

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:16.845
Mukbang!

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:18.825
Yes, let's do it in Korea!

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:26.498
Gallop, what do you want?

00:02:34.964 --> 00:02:37.006
Marshmello needs to be in this video.

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:39.334
Who is Marshmello?

00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:41.510
How about yodeling kid?

00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:43.394
With Adam Rippon!

00:03:02.612 --> 00:03:04.944
Guys, let's do the
In My Feelings challenge.

00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:05.958
Right!

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.432
I love this song!

00:03:09.432 --> 00:03:11.112
Let's hear the remix!

00:03:42.998 --> 00:03:45.062
Wait, wait, wait. 
Hold on, hold on.

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:48.336
You know who really needs to be 
in this Rewind video?

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:51.398
Everyone who managed to do something 
bigger than themselves this year.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.664
Found a way to help the causes 
that matter to them most.

00:03:54.664 --> 00:03:58.087
To everyone who proved it's ok
to talk about mental health this year.

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:01.530
Showing our viewers that it's ok
to go through tough times like that.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.652
It takes a lot of bravery to be that vulnerable
and I'm so proud of this community.

00:04:05.652 --> 00:04:09.698
I think this year's Rewind should 
celebrate the fierce, fabulous

00:04:09.698 --> 00:04:11.591
and empowering art of drag.

00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:14.618
I want to see all of you be your 
own kind of beautiful.

00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:17.739
And to those people who have
raised money in the field of education.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.367
Can we also give a moment to Asian 
representation in entertainment this year?

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:23.760
Major strides were made.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.778
And to the people who put aside 
their differences.

00:04:25.778 --> 00:04:27.615
Yeah, and created something really special.

00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:31.384
Here's to all women in 2018
for finding their voices.

00:04:31.384 --> 00:04:34.998
It's nice seeing how women grew
and were empowered.

00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:37.776
Can we give a moment to working moms?
Let's do it!

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:42.276
To everyone who taught, or learned,
something new this year.

00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:45.337
And to all the refugees and
anyone looking for a home.

00:04:45.337 --> 00:04:49.538
All of us should send a toast to the 
kids who follow their dreams.

00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:54.426
I want to thank the whole community that
always supports during our best and worst.

00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:56.688
We are a family,
we are a team.

00:04:56.688 --> 00:04:58.460
Family is everything.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.224
I want to give a moment to everyone
who supported me when I got sick.

00:05:02.224 --> 00:05:06.311
All of the comments and messages I got
made me feel like I wasn't alone.

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:09.399
We're forgetting something.

00:05:11.312 --> 00:05:14.422
I think we should read the comments.

00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:26.741
Yeah I have a feeling this is going to get
a little bit crazy.

00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:29.511
Let's give the people what they want.

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.548
Aaaahhh

00:06:57.803 --> 00:07:00.093
That's hot, that's hot.
